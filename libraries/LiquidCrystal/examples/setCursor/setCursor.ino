  LiquidCrystal Library - setCursor

 Demonstrates the use a 16x2 LCD display.  The LiquidCrystal
 library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the
 Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you
 can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 This sketch prints to all the positions of the LCD using the
 setCursor() method:

    The circuit for w80x:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin PB0
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin PB4
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin PB1
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin PB3
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin PB5
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin PB2
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * LCD VSS pin to ground
 * LCD VCC pin to 5V
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
 *

// include the library code:
#include "Arduino.h"
#include "LiquidCrystal.h"

// initialize the library by associating any needed LCD interface pin
// with the arduino pin number it is connected to
const int rs = PB0, en = PB4, d4 = PB1, d5 = PB3, d6 = PB5, d7 = PB2;
LiquidCrystal lcd(rs, en, d4, d5, d6, d7);

// these constants won't change.  But you can change the size of
// your LCD using them:
const int numRows = 2;
const int numCols = 16;

void setup() {
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(numCols, numRows);
}

void loop() {
  // loop from ASCII 'a' to ASCII 'z':
  for (int thisLetter = 'a'; thisLetter <= 'z'; thisLetter++) {
    // loop over the columns:
    for (int  thisRow = 0; thisRow < numRows; thisRow++) {
      // loop over the rows:
      for (int thisCol = 0; thisCol < numCols; thisCol++) {
        // set the cursor position:
        lcd.setCursor(thisCol, thisRow);
        // print the letter:
        lcd.write(thisLetter);
        delay(200);
      }
    }
