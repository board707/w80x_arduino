# w80x_duino
Arduino package for [WinnerMicro](http://www.winnermicro.com/) boards, based on XT-E804 MCU.

This is a port of the WinnerMicro W806 SDK to the Arduino world. It uses T-HEAD C-SKY Tools V3.10.29 Minilibc abiv2 toolchain (GCC v6.3.0)

## Boards

- W806 ([pinout](doc/W806_pinout.png)) 
- W801 ([pinout](doc/W801_pinout.png)) 
- Air_103 (W806 clone) ([pinout](doc/Air103_pinout.png)) 

## Package development - what works and what not

The ticked options have been implemented and tested, the unticked ones are under development, and more developers are expected to maintain together

- [x] Arduino IDE package tools for Windows and Linux 
- [x] GPIO
- [x] [HardwareSerial](cores/w806/HardwareSerial.md) class
- [x] ADC
- [x] [PWM](doc/PWM.md)
- [x] [HardwareTimer](libraries/HardwareTimer/Readme.md) lib
- [x] I2C - HardwareI2c, SoftwareI2c
- [x] [SPI](doc/SPI.md)
- [x] [EEPROM](libraries/EEPROM/Readme.md) library
- [x] Stream, Print and String classes
- [x] I2S interface (see libraries/I2S/examples/Wav_SD_Player example)
- [ ] SDIO interface
- [x] [DMA](doc/W_DMA.md)

To detailed development info see the [CHANGES.txt](CHANGES.txt) file.

## Library Compatibility List
The libraries listed below tested to be used with w80x controllers:

* AdafruitGFX and its companion libraries
* SD.h and other related libraries - SdFat.h, SdFile.h etc 
* LiquidCrytal screen library

## Ported Libraries
Below are links to w80x-ported versions of some arduino libraries:

 * [FastLED](https://github.com/board707/FastLED) - the library for controlling an addressable LEDs
 * [MCUFRIEND_kbv](https://github.com/board707/MCUFRIEND_kbv) - the library for 8bits parallel TFT displays

## Installation in Arduino IDE

1. **File -> Preferences**

2. Enter the following URL in the additional development board manager URL:

> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/board707/w80x_arduino/hal-v0.6.0/package_w80x_index.json

  If this doesn't work, try any of these link addresses:

> http://dl.isme.fun/w80x_arduino/package_w80x_index.json

> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/board707/w80x_arduino/hal-v0.6.0/package_w80x_isme_proxy_index.json

**Notes to Linux users**

If you experienced the error at the first build under linux:

`/w80x_duino/tools/w80x_tool/v1.0/lin/wm_tool: /lib64/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.34 not found `

or something like it, just go to your `w80x_duino/tools/w80x_tool/v1.0/lin/` folder and remove the `wm_tool` and `wm_toold` files.
After that start building again and now the error should gone.

### Support
If you have any problems using the package, please submit an issue directly. Developers are welcome to collaborate and develop and submit commits. This project will continue to be updated.
